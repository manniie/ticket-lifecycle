<p>Shows John, an employee opened the ticket, assigned the ticket to the online banking team, gave the customer frequent updates, assigned it to the proper help topic, and set the SLA to Sev-A.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Working The Issue</h3>

<p>The ticket was assigned to the online banking team, Jane took the ticket, and provided an update to the customer that she is working on a resolution to the issue.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Resolution</h3>

<p>Jane found a temporary solution, provides information on the permanent resolution, and set it to resolved.</p>

<p>This is a basic overview of how a user creates a ticket, how it's assigned, and how communication between agents & customer occurs, ultimately leading to a resolution.

However, there are additional scenarios that can arise while a ticket is being processed. A ticket may be reassigned to another department, its severity level may be escalated, or it may need to be reassigned to a more qualified agent or department, depending on the impact the ticket has on the business.

I hope this tutorial provides a clearer understanding and a better general overview of a ticketâ€™s life cycle. Help desk agents can expect to handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day, depending on the size of the company.</p>
